# Calculator

ML to predict odd/eveness of the result of the basic calculation

### notebooks
 Create Data -- Create .csv data
 
 Create Model -- Create and test model
 
 
### TL;DR

  Sorry for lack of documentation (comment in the notebook)
  
  More about NLP rather than math problem
  
  X divided by 0 is even!!
